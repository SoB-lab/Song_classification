# Song_classification

Use the FMA database to create a genre classification tool using deep learning (CNN model) by converting the songs to pictures and applying Fourier transform.


To obtain everything right it should be run as follow:
1) new_database_3152021.py
2) conversion_to_pictures.py
4) gen_datasets.py: Generate the datasets. Should be used either as a function of at the beginning of the program
3) Running of the machine Learning model (call for function in a seperate file)

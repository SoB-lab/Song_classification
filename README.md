# Song_classification

Use the FMA database to create a genre classification tool using deep learning (CNN model) by converting the songs to pictures and applying Fourier transform.


To obtain everything right it should be run as follow:
1) new_database_3152021.py
2) conversion_to_pictures.py
3) seperation_database.py: creates a seperated database for 10% test sample and 90% training data
4) gen_datasets.py: Generate the datasets and run the model. The model is saved in 'my_model' for testing and analysis.
